## Introduction
The Starbucks Order Management System is a command-line application designed to facilitate ordering and processing transactions at Starbucks outlets. This system allows customers to place orders for various beverages and customizations, calculates the total cost, and generates a receipt for the transaction.

### Key Features:

***Menu Display:*** The system starts by displaying a menu of available Starbucks beverages along with their prices and options for customization.

***Order Placement:*** Customers can place orders by specifying the Starbucks beverage, size, quantity, and any desired customizations or add-ons.

***Input Validation:*** The system validates user inputs such as drink selection, quantity, and size to ensure accurate order processing. Furthermore, the system employs a fool-proof feature utilizing the std_formatter function, which formats user inputs by removing spaces and converting characters to lowercase, thereby minimizing errors due to inconsistent input formats.

***Customization Options:*** Depending on the selected Starbucks beverage, customers are provided with options for customizations such as hot or iced variants, as well as additional add-ons or substitutions.

***Order Summary:*** After completing the Starbucks order, the system generates an order summary displaying the details of each item ordered, including price, quantity, and subtotal.

***Transaction Confirmation:*** Customers are prompted to confirm their Starbucks orders and input the payment amount. The system calculates the change due and generates a receipt for the transaction.

***Receipt Generation:*** Upon confirmation, the system generates a receipt in CSV format containing itemized details of the Starbucks order, total cost, payment amount, and change.

***User-Friendly Interface:*** The system provides clear prompts and messages to guide users through the Starbucks ordering process, ensuring a seamless user experience.
